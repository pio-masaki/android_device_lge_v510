===============
Verified BOOTING
Verified working except WiFi as of 7/1/14
Will bootloop on reboot

7-16:
WiFi finally works

TO DO:
=============
Verify the following = GPS, BT, Audio in all forms, internel speakers/mic/headphone/headset/hdmi/dock/BT/etc, hardware acceleration/playback, light/prox/g sensors, full shakedown needed.

Figure out the bootlooping on reboot, factory reset will make it boot, cache wipe only will NOT.

Maybe more, I'm tired.
